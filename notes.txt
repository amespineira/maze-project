-Map Object
  2d array of ints,
  if value is 0, impassable
  if 1, goal
  if adjacent to any non-zero numbers, value is lowest adjacent plus one


  functionality needed:
format input as map object
    issue here: mazes usually made up of a bunch of walls not independent impassable coordinates
        -use separate formatter to turn series of walls into impassable coordinates
    possible limitations as size increases: takes substantially longer to generate relative maps as maze size increases
random generation
displaying on webpage
storing saved mazes
user designed mazes
detecting unsolvable mazes (should be possible with already written code)
*DONE* create relative map
*DONE* find path
