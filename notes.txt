-Map Object
  2d array of ints,
  if value is 0, impassable
  if 1, goal
  if adjacent to any non-zero numbers, value is lowest adjacent plus one


  functionality needed:
format input as map object
    *DONE*issue here: mazes usually made up of a bunch of walls not independent impassable coordinates
        *DONE*-use separate formatter to turn series of walls into impassable coordinates
    other formatting stuff
    possible limitations as size increases: takes substantially longer to generate relative maps as maze size increases
random generation
displaying on webpage
storing saved mazes
user designed mazes
detecting unsolvable mazes (should be possible with already written code)
*DONE* create relative map
*DONE* find path



Tuesday Plan:
  Two directions I see:
    Work more on random generation and algorithmic stuff
    Work on user generation and display stuff
      To do:
        Ability to place start and end points
        Ability to display solution
        Ability to add walls
      Notes:
        Use topbar for selecting stuff, probably going to have to fix the aspect ratio problem
        Have edit view separate from solved view, use different methods and stuff, clear dom and pass in edited map object when displaying solution
          -no need for display stuff during editing process, there almost definitely be problems with performance and stuff, fix after getting basics working
      Step 1:
        work on editing stuff, don't bother integrating algorithmic stuff yet...
