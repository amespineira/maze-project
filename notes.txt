-Map Object
  2d array of ints,
  if value is 0, impassable
  if 1, goal
  if adjacent to any non-zero numbers, value is lowest adjacent plus one


  functionality needed:
format input as map object
    issue here: mazes usually made up of a bunch of walls not independent impassable coordinates
        -use separate formatter to turn series of walls into impassable coordinates
create relative map
find path
